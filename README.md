# IpserLabDemo
This is the README.md file, which usually contains important information pertaining to the code. In the case of this repository, it'll contain information on how to use GitHub.

# Basic setup

## Installing Git 

A lot of these setup processes will be different based on your operating system

MacOS: 
1. Install Homebrew: /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
2. Install Git via Homebrew: brew install git

Windows: TBA

## Cloning the repository onto your computer

Click the green "Code" button and access the dropdown menu, then copy the HTTPS link

MacOS: in Terminal, go to the directory you want to copy the project into, then type "git clone <HTTPS link>"

Windows: TBA
  
Visual studio code: open a new window, click "clone git repository", paste the link into the prompt

Once this step is done, you'll have a copy of the code on your computer and you'll be able to access and edit it, though it's important to note that none of your changes will be seen by anyone else unless you push them (more on that later)
